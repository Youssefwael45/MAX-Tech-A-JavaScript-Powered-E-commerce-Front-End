## Features

This project is a complete front-end implementation of an e-commerce website for a tech store. It is fully responsive and packed with interactive features built with JavaScript and jQuery.

### 1. **Homepage**
-   **Dynamic Greeting:** Welcomes users with a "Good morning," "Good day," or "Good evening" message based on their local time.
-   **Interactive Animations:** Engaging "pulse" animation on the main banner and subtle animations on page load.
-   **Product & Category Previews:** Sections to showcase featured products and main shopping categories.
-   **Functional Search Bar:** A clickable search icon reveals an animated search bar in the navigation.

### 2. **Shop Page**
-   **Product Filtering:** Users can filter products by categories (Laptops, Components, Accessories).
-   **Interactive Product Cards:** Hover effects on product cards to display more information or change appearance.
-   **Dynamic Image Change:** Product images change on hover to give users a better look.
-   **"Out of Stock" Alerts:** A clear alert system for unavailable products.

### 3. **Product Detail Page**
-   **Image Gallery:** A main image with clickable thumbnails to view the product from different angles.
-   **Dynamic Pricing:** The price updates automatically when a user selects different product options (e.g., changing RAM or SSD).
-   **Quantity Selector:** Users can increase or decrease the quantity, with the price updating in real-time.
-   **Add to Cart:** A functional "Add to Cart" button that updates the cart item count in the navigation bar.

### 4. **Shopping Cart**
-   **Full Cart Management:** Users can view all added items, update quantities, or remove items.
-   **Live Price Calculation:** The total cart price is automatically recalculated when quantities change or items are removed.
-   **Out of Stock Status:** The "Proceed to Checkout" action can trigger a visual "out of stock" warning on specific items.

### 5. **User Authentication Forms (Sign-In & Sign-Up)**
-   **Real-time Form Validation:** Instant feedback for users when filling out forms. It validates:
    -   Name (cannot be empty).
    -   Email format.
    -   Age (must be at least 12 years old).
    -   Password strength (must contain letters, numbers, and be at least 6 characters).
    -   Password confirmation (passwords must match).
-   **Interactive UI:** Input fields change color on focus and blur for a better user experience.

### 6. **Payment Page**
-   **Smart Form Fields:** The "State" and "Zip" fields are automatically filled based on the "City" selected by the user (for major Egyptian cities).
-   **Conditional Logic:** The credit card information section only appears if the "Credit Card" payment option is selected.
-   **Email & Credit Card Validation:** Real-time validation for email format and automatic formatting for credit card numbers (adding spaces every 4 digits).
